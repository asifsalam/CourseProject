Getting & Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================================

Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to clean, manipulate and transform data into a data set useful for a specific analysis.  The base data used in the project are activity data collected from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  The data and associated descripition are available on the website that hosts the data here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In this project we are required to create an R script called run_analysis.R that accomplishes the following tasks:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The results must be communicated via github, and include the following:
1. A tidy data set as described above.
2. A link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed 
to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4. A README.md in the repo with the scripts. This should explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
